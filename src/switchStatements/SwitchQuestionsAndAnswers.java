	/*1. why default has not break generally?
	Ans: Because default case is always written in the last of the switch
	statement, hence when default executes, it bydefault goes out of the 
	switch statement so no need to explictly write break keywod.
	
	2. Why float is not used in switch case?
			Ans: because in floating point there might get many number of 
	cases just by changing the numbers after the decimal points, hence it 
	is not used.*/
